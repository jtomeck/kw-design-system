      - subheading: An action cleared the content
        text: Sometimes a user action can clear data and/or content that was there previously. It is helpful to let the user know that it is okay that there is nothing there. In some cases it may be helpful to tell the user what action cleared the section or even give them the option to undo that action.

      - subheading: There are no results to display
        text: Sometimes a user will complete an action that does not yield any results. It is helpful to prompt the user, letting them know their action did not return anything and to perform it again with modifications.
