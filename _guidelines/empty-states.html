# Page info
definition: Moments in a user's experience where there is no content or data to display.
excerpt: Empty states provide us with the opportunity to improve the user's experience by helping to avoid confusion and keep them engaged. A useful empty state should provide the user with information about what is happening, why it's happening and what they should do about it.
