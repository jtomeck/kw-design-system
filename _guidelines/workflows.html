title: Workflows
layout: collections

# Page Hero
definition: Processes put in place in order to easily take users from point A to point B in an application.
excerpt: Workflows are intended to minimize initial clutter, giving the user the tools and/or information they need when they need it. There will always be more than one workflow for an application, so it is important to divide your tools and features into categories so that you're able to organize your application around it.

# Page Content
sections:
    - type: list
      heading: Different ways to define your workflow(s)
      content:
        - subheading: Split things up into different views (pages)
          text: Views can be used to separate out different steps of a workflow. You can imagine this workflow as a sort of "wizard" where completing each step takes the user to a different view. Alternatively, views can be used to separated out entirely different workflows. A data visualization app, for example, would most likely have multiple workflows. You might have 2 separate views. One for selecting data/files and one for visualizing what you've chosen. You could then go back to the data selection view to add additional data or select completely new data altogether.

        - subheading: Put tools/settings into a toolbar or sidebar
          text: Toolbars and sidebars can be used within a view or views to further help organize your tools into workflows. For example, in a data visualization app, a sidebar could be home to tools used for interacting with the visualization, while a top toolbar could be used as a home for global tools such as zoom, pan, rotate, etc. Your workflows are now defined so that a user knows where to go for each.

        - subheading: Make use of tabs or panels
          text: Tabs and panels may be used within toolbars or sidebars. Using our data visualization app example, let's say you have different things you'd like to do to interact with the visualization. You know these tools live in the sidebar, but you may want to break them down further. You can group similar tools (such as color and opacity) into panels, or break down different ways of interacting with the visualization into tabs (such as annotations and viewport options).

        - subheading: It is okay to hide content behind actions
          text: Sometimes you might want to hide certain things until the user completes an action. A color picker is a good example of this (although there are countless examples). There might be a button that says "choose color" and when the user clicks it, the color picker will show up. It may be an additional click, but depending on the amount of content or how many tools/settings you have, it might be best to avoid the clutter of displaying everything up front. There are many ways to handle hidden content (modals, sidebars, toolbars, etc), so be sure to pick the one that's right for your workflow(s).
